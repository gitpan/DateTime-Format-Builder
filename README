Changes for 0.75 (29 Jun 2003)
   - Silly MANIFEST.SKIP entry caused dispatch stuff to
     be skipped.
   - Dispatch Parser class added, which allows us to make
     groups of parsers and hop quickly to them.
   - length parameter can now be an arrayref, hence we can
     have a parser belong to more than one length group.
   - Version numbers are all identical now.
   - Regex Parser can call custom constructors.
   - Wrapped method only regards undef as a failure.
