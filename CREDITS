CREDITS FOR DateTime::Format::Builder 0.72

Dave Rolsky (DROLSKY) for kickstarting the DateTime project,
writing DateTime::Format::ICal and
DateTime::Format::MySQL, and some much needed review.

Joshua Hoblitt (JHOBLITT) for the concept, some of the API,
and more much needed review.

Kellan Elliott-McCrea (KELLAN) for even more review,
suggestions, DateTime::Format::W3CDTF and the encouragement to
rewrite these docs almost 100%!

Claus Färber (CFAERBER) for having me get around to
fixing the auto-constructor writing, providing the
'args'/'self' patch, and suggesting the multi-callbacks.

Rick Measham (RICKM) for DateTime::Format::Strptime
which Builder now supports.

Simon Cozens (SIMON) for saying it was cool.
